# About

The `.template` directory contains sample files and templates that serve as a starting point for creating new components, configurations, or documentation within the project. These templates help ensure consistency in structure and style across the project, making it easier to onboard new contributors and maintain best practices. Use these files as references or building blocks when expanding your project.

# Whatâ€™s Included

- **.gitignore**: Specifies the files and directories that Git should ignore. This helps prevent temporary files, build artifacts, and other non-essential items from being committed to the repository.

- **LICENSE**: Contains the open-source license for the project. This file outlines the terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.

- **pyproject.toml**: Provides metadata and configuration for the Python project. It defines build system requirements, project details, and can be used to configure tools and dependencies in a standardized manner.

- **README.md**: Serves as the main documentation for the project. It typically includes an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other important information for users and contributors.
